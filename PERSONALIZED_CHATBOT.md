## 💬 How It Works

### **First-Time Questions**
**User**: "How can I save money?"
**Student Response**: "Great question about savings! As a student with flexible income, I'd suggest starting micro - save your daily coffee money or round up purchases."
**Professional Response**: "Perfect! With your $5,000/month income, aim for the 50/30/20 rule. That means $1,000/month in savings - very doable with moderate-budget adjustments."

### **Repeat Questions** 
**Same User Asks Again**: "How can I save money?"
**New Response**: "Since we talked about saving before, let me give you a fresh angle. Consider the 1% rule: increase your savings rate by just 1% each month."
